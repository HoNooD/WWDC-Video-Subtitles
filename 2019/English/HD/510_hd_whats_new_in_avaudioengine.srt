00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,976
>> Hello and welcome to our


3
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,936
session about modernizing your


4
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:12,436
audio app.


5
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:15,216
My name is Peter Vasil and I'm a


6
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:16,816
software engineer in the core


7
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:17,416
audio team.


8
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:20,226
Let's start with audio units.


9
00:00:22,496 --> 00:00:23,626
Support for carbon


10
00:00:23,626 --> 00:00:25,846
component-based audio units will


11
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:27,646
be removed in a future MacOS


12
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:28,106
release.


13
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:30,856
We encourage hosts to use the


14
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:32,756
AudioComponent API for audio


15
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:33,796
unit discovery.


16
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:37,876
With the next OS release,


17
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:39,606
AudioHardwarePlugin-based


18
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,256
plugins are disabled by default.


19
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:44,496
We recommend using the


20
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:46,696
AudioServerPlugin API instead.


21
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:49,616
For now, disabled plugins can be


22
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,276
reenabled in the audio MIDI


23
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:52,406
setup utility.


24
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:54,886
But support will be removed


25
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:56,716
completely in a future MacOS


26
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:57,500
release.


27
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,166
With the next OS release, we


28
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,186
will introduce some


29
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:03,106
deprecations.


30
00:01:03,626 --> 00:01:06,066
AUGraph, Inter-App Audio and


31
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,016
OpenAL will be deprecated.


32
00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:10,256
We encourage developers to


33
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:12,656
switch over to AVAudioEngine as


34
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,526
a replacement for AUGraph and


35
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:15,306
OpenAL.


36
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:18,496
For Inter-App Audio, please use


37
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:20,576
audio unit extensions instead.


38
00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:23,956
The 3D mixer parameters have


39
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:25,356
been unified across all


40
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:26,136
platforms.


41
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:28,876
For details, please refer to the


42
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:31,106
AudioUnitParameters header file


43
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:33,156
for a list of new and deprecated


44
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:33,936
parameters.


45
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,726
For more information, please


46
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:38,366
visit the developer website.


47
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:41,626
Thank you for your attention.
